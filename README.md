# Slow roman-arabic (and back forth) implementation

Well, my idea was implementing this simple problem using the same 
algorithm I used in Prolog (<a href="https://github.com/leandrosansilva/toy_prolog_roman_to_arabic">here</a>),
but in C++, by somehow simulating the prolog backtracking behaviour.

It does not aim to have high performance, but just to check how it behaves in a procedural language.

Have fun!
